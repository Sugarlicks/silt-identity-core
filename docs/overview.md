# Overview

SILT Core is an identity layer that formalises status, standing, and authority before attributes, agency, or credentials.

Most identity systems begin with identifiers and claims, then attempt to patch in consent and delegation later. SILT Core begins earlier, with the principal and the capacity in which they act, so consent and delegation can be expressed as explicit, auditable constraints.

SILT Core is designed as a composable infrastructure layer: specifications, schemas, and minimal reference code that downstream systems can adopt without committing to a single wallet, chain, or identity stack.

Downstream contexts may include governance systems or public-interest documentation layers, but those sit outside the scope of this repository. SILT Core remains focused on the shared primitives that make lawful agency and privacy-preserving disclosure enforceable.
